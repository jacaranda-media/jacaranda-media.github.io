School closures around the country during the COVID-19 pandemic have a negative impact on student learning and disproportionately impact those with fewer resources. It is important that we mitigate the impact of these closures, these have long-term impacts on the STEM pipeline.

CalMentors is a tutoring program we started which aims to help students navigate distance learning. UC Berkeley undergraduates will be matched with high-school and middle-school students and teachers to provide small group tutoring for students who might not have a parent or other adult at home who can help them with their schoolwork.
